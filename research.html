<dt> <a href="">The theory of F-rational signature, joint with Kevin Tucker.</a> </dt>
    <dd>F-rational signature was defined by Hochster and Yao to detect F-rational singularities in the same way F-signature detects strong F-regularity. Later, Sannai defined dual F-signature, an invariant of different spirit but same purpose. We show that the dual F-signature is equal to a modified version of the Hochster-Yao invariant and use this to show a number of desirable properties pushing the state of knowledge almost to that of F-signature.

</dt>
<dd> Watanabe and Yoshida asked if the simple A<sub>1</sub> singularity has the smallest Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity, or the mildest Hilbert-Kunz singularity, among singular rings. This question was answered affirmatively in many cases, but is still open. We consider an analogous conjecture for F-signature and are able to prove it in the toric case. Furthermore, it is known that non-Gorenstein rings cannot have F-signature larger than 1/2, and we are able to classify toric rings for which the equality happens.

We apply the framework to get a transformation rule for differential signature, a characteristic-free invariant due to Brenner, Jeffries, and Núñez-Betancourt. Similarly to F-signature the consequence is a bound on the order of the local étale fundamental group.

<dd>Originally, I wanted to extend my earlier Hilbert-Kunz paper by building an equimultiplicity theory for F-signature, but with Thomas's incredible insight the paper turned into much more! The gist of the paper is rigidity of many Frobenius-induced asymptotic invariants in strongly F-regular rings: if the values of the limit at a point and its specialization are equal, then necessarily entire functions are equal. This gives nice proofs of some classic results.

This paper gives a somewhat new proof of semicontinuity of Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity in families 
and shows semicontinuity of Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity in families of finite type. The most surprising aspect is that the bound happens to be characteristic-free, so the result can be applied for families over the integers, giving a partial answer to a question of Brenner, Li, and Miller.

In this short note, we give a unified treatment on many results connecting colength of some closure of an ideal and its multiplicity. Most of the results are already known and our new contribution is showing under very mild assumptions that in a singular ring the colength of an integrally closed ideals is always strictly less than its multiplicity.

<h3 class="mb-10">Stability of singularities.</h3>
<p>Many deep theorems concern relations between analytic and algebraic.
An example of such theorem and relation is <i>finite determinacy</i> of hypersurface isolated singularities of Samuel: a hypersurface defined by powers series can be truncated to give an equivalent singularity. 
In fact, he showed that we always get an equivalent singularity if we <i>perturb</i> the equation by adding terms of sufficiently high degree. Unfortunately, these results do not hold without assuming isolated singularity, and we instead must study what properties and invariants are stable.

<dt> <a href="">Stability and deformation of F-singularities, joint with Alessandro De Stefani.
</a> </dt>
    <dd>We start developing a theory of m-adic stability of F-singulaties. By proving a continuity result for F-rational signature, we show that F-rational singularities are stable. Stability is usually a stronger property than deformation, and we use the example of Singh to show that F-pure and strongly F-regular singularities are not generally stable. This also shows a mistake in my earlier paper with Thomas Polstra: even an individual splitting number is not continuous. We also present a few cases where F-injective singularities are stable.

    This paper was pretty much entirely done in a week when Quy and I visited Linquan in Purdue! 
    Srinivas and Trivedi investigated what happens to the Hilbert-Samuel function when we perturb generators of an ideal by adding terms of very high order. After showing a number of nice results, they asked whether a sufficiently small perturbation of a filter-regular sequence (a generalization of a regular sequence) does not change the Hilbert-Samuel function. We answer this question affirmatively, giving the greatest possible level of generality where such a result may hold.

Postnikov and Shapiro showed how to each algebra one can attach a graded artinian algebra that will count spanning forests. Inspired by the work of Nenashev and Shapiro, we attach to each graph and a polynomial a filtered algebra. Thus each graph produces a constructible stratification of the space of polynomials that associates to a polynomial the sequence of the dimensions of the filtration. The main conjecture is that this stratification should distinguish graphs and we make initial steps.
